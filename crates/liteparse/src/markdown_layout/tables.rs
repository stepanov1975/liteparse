//
// Catches borderless 2-column tables that the main `try_detect_table` rejects
// because `TABLE_MIN_COLUMNS = 3`. Signature:
//
//   - ≥ DESC_LIST_MIN_ROWS rows where col 0 is a short label (≤ DESC_LIST_LABEL_MAX_CHARS)
//     and col 1 is anything (typically a paragraph or bullet list).
//   - Stable x-anchors for both columns (within DESC_LIST_TRACK_TOL_PT).
//   - Clear inter-column gap (col1.start_x - col0.end_x ≥ DESC_LIST_MIN_COL_GAP_PT).
//   - Asymmetric content: at least one row's col 1 is meaningfully longer than
//     its col 0 — rules out symmetric two-column body prose / newspaper layouts.
//
// Handles two PDFium quirks:
//   - Wrap continuations: a single-cell line at col 1's anchor extends the
//     previous row's col 1.
//   - Merged-span rows: PDFium occasionally emits both columns of a row as a
//     single text item starting at col 0's anchor (kerning happens to be tight
//     across the column gap). We split on the whitespace position closest to
//     col 1's anchor and treat the result as a normal 2-cell row.

// vertically immediate (A.end == B.start), reasonably close in y, and share
// either identical tracks (Case Same) or A's tracks are a 1-column-shorter
// subset of B's tracks (Case Subset). Subset merges fold A into B's header.

// one real table with sparse rows (row-label column present on some rows
// only, empty value columns on others) fragments into several runs at
// different column counts, with stranded single rows between them. The pairs
// of fragments rarely satisfy `try_merge_pair`'s same-cols / |A|+1==|B|
// cases. This pass takes the opposite approach: instead of mapping fragment
// columns onto each other, it re-derives the *union* column track set from
// the raw PDFium span positions across the whole cluster and re-extracts
// every line against those tracks. Sparse rows get empty cells, merged spans
// split at track anchors, and the cluster emits as one table.
//
// Only fires when ≥2 table runs are already y-adjacent — prose never enters
// this path, so the false-positive surface is limited to "two genuinely
